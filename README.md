# odin-recipes
This project was fun and easy. I could make decent website with knowledge and understanding I had.

Here is what is I did in step by step:
1. First created a repo in github named it odin-recipes.
2. Then cloned that repo into my local machine using ssh in repo directory.
3. After doing that i created index.html and filled boiler plate and added some basic infos in it according to assignment.
4. After that I created recipes directory from my terminal, in that directory I created pancake.html.
5. Then I linked it into index.html using anchor tags.
6. After doing that, I filled boiler plate and went to https://www.allrecipes.com/ for reference but I copied entire recipe from there.
7. I added heading and image from https://www.allrecipes.com/, gave some description, added ingredients and at last I added Steps/Direction.
8. I did same for next two recipe.
9. I did commits after each iteration, and planned to push the code at last. In fact, I haven't done it still I'll do it after completing this readme.md file
